# ADR 0001: Better Auth platform admin

## Status

Accepted (2026-07-28)

## Context

Internal KPI routes (`/admin/stats/*`) were gated by `user_settings.is_admin`, a
column maintained outside Better Auth. Bondery already uses Better Auth for
sessions and is adopting more of its plugin surface.

## Decision

- Enable Better Auth `admin()` with `user.role = admin` as the sole platform
  operator signal.
- Drop `user_settings.is_admin` after backfilling `user.role` from existing rows.
- Disable impersonation by omitting `impersonate` and `impersonate-admins` from
  the custom admin role permissions.
- `verifyAdmin` checks `isPlatformAdmin(userId)` (Prisma: `role = admin`,
  `!banned`).
- Deploy-time promotion via `BONDERY_PRIVATE_PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAILS` and
  `provision-platform-admins`.

## Consequences

- No dual-check with legacy `is_admin`.
- `/me/session` exposes `isPlatformAdmin` for webapp layout gating.
- Operators provisioned by email at deploy.
