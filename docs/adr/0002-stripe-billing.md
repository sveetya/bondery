# ADR 0002: Stripe billing (custom Fastify)

## Status

Accepted (2026-07-29)

## Context

Bondery billing was integrated with Polar.sh via a webhook-maintained `subscriptions`
mirror, Fastify routes at `/api/subscriptions`, and embedded checkout in the webapp.
We are migrating to Stripe Billing for production readiness, student promotion codes,
Smart Retries, and a richer subscription lifecycle.

Better Auth ships a [Stripe plugin](https://better-auth.com/docs/plugins/stripe) that
couples checkout, webhooks, and parallel subscription tables to the auth layer.

## Decision

- Use **Stripe Billing** as the system of record; keep the existing Postgres
  `subscriptions` table as a **webhook-maintained mirror** for fast access control.
- Integrate with a **custom Fastify layer** (`apps/api/src/services/billing/*`,
  `/api/webhooks/stripe`) — not the Better Auth Stripe plugin.
- Use **Stripe Embedded Checkout** (`ui_mode: embedded`) in the webapp via
  `@stripe/stripe-js` `initEmbeddedCheckout`.
- Student discounts via Stripe Promotion Codes (`allow_promotion_codes: true`).
- **15-day trial** on both monthly and annual Prices (`trial_period_days: 15`).
- Trial-ending email on `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`.
- Gate new upgrades behind `BONDERY_PUBLIC_BILLING_UPGRADES_ENABLED` (default `false`)
  until production Stripe is configured.

## Why not Better Auth Stripe plugin

1. Bondery already owns billing at `/api/subscriptions` and `/api/webhooks/*`.
2. Mobile and OpenAPI clients depend on resource-keyed subscription responses.
3. `pending_subscriptions` supports checkout-before-signup; plugin tables would duplicate
   or conflict with the mirror model.
4. Webhooks belong on `/api/webhooks/stripe` with raw-body HMAC verification, matching
   existing integration patterns.

## Consequences

- Polar code, env vars, and schema names are removed in the same migration.
- `GET /api/subscriptions` reads the mirror only — no live Stripe API calls.
- `payment_failure_count` and `hasPremiumAccess()` implement a 3-attempt grace period
  before blocking premium features.
- Operators configure Product, Prices, Coupon/Promo, Smart Retries, and webhook endpoint
  in the Stripe Dashboard.
