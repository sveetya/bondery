# ADR 0003: SeaweedFS object storage (S3-compatible)

## Status

Accepted (2026-07-29)

## Context

Contact avatars and LinkedIn logos were stored in **Supabase Storage** with **imgproxy** for on-the-fly resize/quality transforms. The API recently gained a `StorageAdapter` abstraction with optional local disk, S3, and Supabase drivers.

Requirements for the next storage generation:

- **Bundled SeaweedFS** in the default Bondery Docker Compose stack (production and self-host).
- **S3 API only** via `@aws-sdk/client-s3` — no local disk adapter, no Supabase storage adapter.
- **Keep** the storage module service layer (`StorageAdapter`, `getStorage()`, bucket helpers).
- **No image proxy route** — normalize images on upload with Sharp instead.
- **No external S3** providers in this phase.

## Decision

1. Run **SeaweedFS** (master, volume, filer, S3 gateway) in `deploy/bondery/` compose.
2. API uses a single **`S3Storage`** implementation; `getStorage()` requires S3 env vars (no `BONDERY_STORAGE_DRIVER`).
3. Use **real S3 buckets** `avatars` and `linkedin-logos` (not one physical bucket with key prefixes).
4. **Public reads:** `BONDERY_PUBLIC_STORAGE_URL` points at Traefik → SeaweedFS S3 gateway with **anonymous GetObject** on those buckets. `getPublicUrl` returns `{publicBaseUrl}/{bucket}/{key}`.
5. **Uploads:** Sharp normalizes to JPEG (max edge ~512px avatars, ~256px logos) before `PutObject`.
6. **Remove** `GET /files/*`, local disk adapter, Supabase storage adapter, and imgproxy transform query params on avatar URLs.
7. **Migrate** existing objects with `packages/db/scripts/migrate-storage-from-supabase.ts`; decommission Supabase `storage-api` and `imgproxy` after cutover.

## Why not an image proxy

- Avoids extra API CPU, caching, and SSRF surface for a self-host stack that already serves static objects efficiently.
- Sharp on write delivers consistent JPEGs; clients use CSS for display sizing.
- Trade-off: no on-the-fly variants — acceptable for avatar-sized assets.

## Why not presigned URLs for reads

Avatars appear in lists, sync payloads, and email with long-lived URLs. Presigned reads add expiry and refresh complexity without security benefit over UUID-scoped public paths (same model as today’s public Supabase buckets).

## Consequences

- **Breaking env:** remove `BONDERY_STORAGE_DRIVER`, `BONDERY_PRIVATE_STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH`; require five S3 + public URL vars.
- **Breaking URLs:** avatar/logo domains change to `BONDERY_PUBLIC_STORAGE_URL`.
- **API:** add `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `sharp` to `apps/api`.
- **Mobile:** stop using Supabase storage client for avatar URL construction.
- **Avatar transform query params** (`width`, `height`, `quality`) become no-ops until schema deprecation.
- Supabase Postgres/Auth remain; only storage services are removed from compose.

## Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Rejected because |
|-------------|------------------|
| Keep local disk for dev | User requirement: SeaweedFS only |
| Single S3 bucket + key prefix | Awkward public URLs; native buckets are simpler |
| Filer HTTP API | S3 gateway matches existing adapter direction |
| External AWS/R2 | Out of scope for this phase |
| Image proxy route | Explicitly out of scope |
