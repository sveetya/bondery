# States and labels

## Internal project

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Identifier | `MAIN` |
| UUID | `5ab1d2fc-fe39-4adf-af3c-bad0165e151f` |
| View | Kanban board + cycles |
| Timezone | UTC (cycles Mon–Sun) |

Default owner UUID: `fe2bd70b-7756-40cf-b771-c767fc2c3559` (Marek Svitek).

## Workflow states

| Plane group | State | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| backlog | **Intake** | Raw ideas, drafts, agent-created cards awaiting sanity check (default, triage) |
| backlog | **Icebox** | Valid work, not now — reviewed but deferred |
| unstarted | **Bet** | Reviewed and roughly scoped; may enter a weekly cycle |
| unstarted | **Bet for Next Cycle** | Queued for next weekly cycle (Mon–Sun) |
| started | **Building** | Actively worked in the active cycle |
| started | **Blocked** | Blocked by external party — blocker details in comments only |
| completed | **Release queue** | Finished; waiting for release and changelog mention |
| completed | **Released** | Shipped and archived |
| cancelled | **Won't do** | Declined — reason required in comments |

### Transition rules

```
Intake → (sanity check) → Icebox | Bet | Bet for Next Cycle
Bet for Next Cycle → (cycle setup Mon) → Bet → Building
Building → Release queue → Released
Icebox → Bet (when prioritized) | Won't do (stale 60d+)
Blocked → Building (when unblocked, via comment)
```
